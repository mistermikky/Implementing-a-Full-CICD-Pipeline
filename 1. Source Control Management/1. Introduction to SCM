   - all code changes made by devs will need to be tracked in SCM 
   - Devs will use SCM to track their changes seprately and then merge them together
   
* All pieces of automation that need to interact with the source code will use SCM:
   - Continuous integration ( CI ) will get the code from SCM
   - SCM will notify the CI server when code needs to be built
