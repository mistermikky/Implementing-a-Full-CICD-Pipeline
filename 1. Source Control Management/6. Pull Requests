6. Pull Requests
================
Pull requests often play an important role in a CI/CD workflow. This will introduces the concept of pull requests and demonstrates how to create and merge a pull request on GitHub.
After completing this you should have a basic understanding of pull requests that will be useful as you proceed in implementing a CI/CD pipeline.


Pull Requests:
--------------
Pull requests are not actually a feature of the git software itself. However, they are a useful tool offered by many git remote server implementations, such as github.

Usually, teams work using multiple branches to manage all of their changes. At some point, these branches need to be merged together (prefereably as often as possible).

Merges can he handled locally using git, but another way to do this is through pull requests.

A pull request is a request made by a developer to merge their changes into another branch (usually a shared mainline). It gives other team members a chance to review the changes before performing the merge.
