2. Installing Git
==================
Before you can begin using git, you need to install and configure it. I will walk you through everything that needs to be done in order to install and configure git, and it will also demonstrate each step.
After completing this, you should be able to install and configure git so that it can authenticate with GitHub.com.
You can find additional documentation on these topics in the following locations:
Git installation instructions: https://git-scm.com/downloads .


Installing Git:
---------------
Git installation instructions for your system:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

On a Linux distro that uses RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)

$ sudo yum -y install git

$ git --version      // if its command returns successful it means git is properly installed


Configuring You Name and Email:
--------------------------------
After installing git, you need to set the name and email that will be associated with your commits. 
When using GitHub, it is best to use and email address that is associated with your GitHub account.

$ git config --global user.name "<your name>"
$ git config --global user.email <your email>


Setting up Private Key Access:
------------------------------
An easy way to authenticate with a remote git server like GitHub is to use an ssh key pair.
On a CentOS environment, you can generate an SSH key pair like this:

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

This command will prompt you for several things. These can be left as their defaults, though it is good practice to enter a passphrase.
If you do use a passphrase, make sure you remember what it is.

After generating the key pair, copy the contents of  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

go to GitHub.com ---> click your profile image at the top right, ----> then click "settings" ---> "SSH and GPG Keys"  ---> Click "New ssh key"
enter a name and paste the contents of id_rsa.pub into the key field, then submit the form.




Note: refer to the GitHub guide for more info, or if you want to set up a key on your own environment:
