2. Installing Gradle
====================
Before you can begin using Gradle to create build automation, you need to be able to install it. This will walk you through the process of installing Gradle. It will also introduce you to a slightly more advanced way of installing and using Gradle, known as the Gradle Wrapper. After completing this you should be able to install Gradle and the Gradle Wrapper so that you can execute Gradle builds.

You can find more information about installing Gradle at https://gradle.org/install/


Installing Gradle:
------------------
Gradle can be easily installed with a package manager.
Dependencies: Java JDK 7 or higher.

On some systems, you will neeed to download and extract a zip file.

Installation instructions for a variety of environments can be found at:
https://gradle.org/install


You can verify that your installations is working with:

$gradle --version




Here are the commands used to install gradle:
---------------------------------------------

$ cd ~/
$ wget -O ~/gradle-4.7-bin.zip https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.7-bin.zip
$ sudo yum -y install unzip java-1.8.0-openjdk
$ sudo mkdir /opt/gradle
$ sudo unzip -d /opt/gradle/ ~/gradle-4.7-bin.zip

$ sudo vi /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh
Put this text into gradle.sh:


export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gradle/gradle-4.7/bin


Then set permissions on gradle.sh:
----------------------------------
$sudo chmod 755 /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh


Finally, after logging out of the server and logging back in:
--------------------------------------------------------------
$ gradle --version



The Gradle Wrapper:
--------------------
One of the feature of Gradle that we will use in the Gradle Wrapper.

From the Gradle site: "The Wrapper is a script that invokes a declared version of Gradle, downloading it beforehand if necessary."

Gradle Wrapper allows Gradle to install itself using just the files from your project's source control.


The Wrapper is useful because:
	- It removes the need to have Gradle installed beforehand in order to run the build
	- Ensures the project is always built with a specific version of Gradle
	- Lets you build multiple projects with different Gradle versions on one systems
	- Anyone (or any automated process) can run the build quickly and easily - they only need java
	
	
	
Installing The Gradle Wrapper:
------------------------------
If you already have a normal Gradle install on your system, you can use it to easily install the wrapper:
	- cd /your/project/root/directory
	- gradle wrapper

you should also add the line .gradle to your .gitingore file.


This will place a script file in your project's root directory called gradlew (there is also a gradlew.bat for Widnows systems).

Run Gradle commands against your project like this:
	- cd /your/project/root/directory
	- ./gradlew build


And the commands used to install and run the Gradle Wrapper:
-------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd ~/
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
$ gradle wrapper
$ ./gradlew build
